This Python script uses the TextBlob library to correct spelling errors in a list of words. The script initializes a list of misspelled words and creates an empty list to store the corrected words. It then iterates through the list, applies the TextBlob spell correction method to each word, and appends the corrected word to the list. The script prints the original list of incorrect words and the corrected words.
